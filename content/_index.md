Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding
area. Our headteacher is Ms Knox, and we are part of a three school headship
with Coldingham and Cockburnspath Primary Schools.

We currently have three classes and four teachers: P1-2 with XX (insert email
address), P3-4 with Mrs Sim (insert email address) and P5-7 with Mr Swan (insert
email address) and Ms XX (insert email address).

We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community – the children from Ayton, Coldingham and Cockburnspath move up to Eyemouth High School together with children from Reston Primary School and Eyemouth Primary School.
