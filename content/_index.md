Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding
area. Our headteacher is Ms Knox, and we are part of a three school headship
with Coldingham and Cockburnspath Primary Schools.

We currently have three classes and four teachers:

* P1-2, taught by XX
* P3-4, taught by [Mrs Sim](mailto:gw21simsharonsbc@glowmail.org.uk), and Miss Grossart on Thursdays
* P5-7, taught Mr Swan and Ms XX

We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community – the children from Ayton, Coldingham and Cockburnspath move up to Eyemouth High School together with children from Reston Primary School and Eyemouth Primary School.
