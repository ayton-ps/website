Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding area. Our headteacher is Ms Knox, and we are part of a three school headship with Coldingham and Cockburnspath Primary Schools.

We currently have three classes and four teachers:

* P1-4, taught by [Mrs Iona Pearson](mailto:gw22pearsoniona@glow.sch.uk) and [Mrs Pauline Lannagan](mailto:gw17lannaganpauline@glow.sch.uk)
* P5-6, taught by Mrs Debbie Higson (until Mrs Hunter returns from maternity leave)
* P7, taught by [Mr Patrick Swan](mailto:gw19swanpatrick@glow.sch.uk)

Katherine Bridgewater is our PE specialist.

We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community – the children from Ayton, Coldingham and Cockburnspath move up to Eyemouth High School together with children from Reston Primary School and Eyemouth Primary School.
