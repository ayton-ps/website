O﻿ur names are Murdo, Frazer, Zachary, Jack and Alexander.

I﻿n class recently we have been doing 3D shapes, 2D shapes. We have also been doing Art- Ra patterns, where we rsprinkled rice and lentils on to paper.  We have left the art to dry so we haven't seen the finished product yet!

T﻿he cleaner was pleased to see that we cleaned up the mess. 

T﻿hat's all for now.

S﻿peak soon.
