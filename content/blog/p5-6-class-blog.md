In Primary 5/6 everybody takes part in the learning. Our timetable is -

Morning - Spelling, Literacy and Reading

Between Break and Lunch - Maths

Afternoon - We have been doing Topic and Art

Primary 5/6 is a great class to be in and feels very big to be a part of. The classroom is big and spacious, so that we have the right amount of space to work in.

See you soon.

Love P5/6
