Iï»¿n Numeracy we have been multiplying 2 digit numbers by other sets of 2 digit numbers. We have also been revising basic division strategies. In Literacy we did a "50 Word Epic" task. This involved writing 50 words on any topic of our choice one day and then add 50 more words to the task, the next day. We have also been doing Reading Eggs. Today (14.11.22) we have been learning about Gravity, as part of our "Materials, Forces and Electricity" Topic.
