Welcome to P7. We have started to work on new topics in our work. 

In Literacy we have started to learn about poetry.  So far we have learned about 'Limerick' poems. They all have 5 lines, two sets of rhyming words, the last word on the last line and the last word on the second line always rhyme.

In Numeracy we have started to learn about negative numbers. A negative (-) and a negative (-) make a positive (+). A positive (+) and a negative (-) make a negative (-).

In P.E we have started to do gymnastics again. We have been practising our rolls - forward rolls, dive forward rolls, sideways rolls, tuck rolls, teddybear rolls, rocking backwards rolls and normal backwards rolls. 

In Music we have been practising 'Under the Sea' by Alan Menken on the ukulele. We need to practice going quicker when changing our chords.

Thank you for reading this!
