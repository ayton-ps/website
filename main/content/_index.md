      ## 👋


      Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the
      surrounding area. Our interim head teacher is Mrs Horsburgh, who is the
      head teacher of Reston Primary School.


      We currently have three classes: P1–4, P5–6, and P7. See our [staff page](/staff) for more information.


      We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community (“Eyemouth cluster”) – children from Ayton, Coldingham, Cockburnspath, Eyemouth and Reston primary schools move up together to Eyemouth High School.
