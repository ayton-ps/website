      ## 👋


      Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding area. Our head teacher is Mrs Horsburgh, who is also the head teacher of neighbouring [Reston Primary School](https://restonprimaryschool.wordpress.com).


      For the 2023–24 academic year we will have three classes: P1–3, P4–5, and P6–7. See our [staff page](/staff) for more information.


      We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community (“Eyemouth cluster”) – children from Ayton, Coldingham, Cockburnspath, Eyemouth and Reston primary schools move up together to Eyemouth High School.
