      ## 👋


      Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding area. Our interim head teacher is Mrs Horsburgh, who is the head teacher of Reston Primary School.


      For the 2023–24 academic year we will have three classes: P1–3, P4–5, and P6–7. See our [staff page](/staff) for more information.


      We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community (“Eyemouth cluster”) – children from Ayton, Coldingham, Cockburnspath, Eyemouth and Reston primary schools move up together to Eyemouth High School.
