Our school is for children in P1-P7 for children from Ayton and the surrounding area. Our interim head teacher is Mrs Horsburgh, who is the head teacher of Reston Primary School.

We currently have three classes and four teachers:

* P1-4, taught by [Mrs Iona Pearson](mailto:gw22pearsoniona@glow.sch.uk) and [Mrs Pauline Lannagan](mailto:gw17lannaganpauline@glow.sch.uk)
* P5-6, taught by Mrs Debbie Higson (until Mrs Hunter returns from maternity leave)
* P7, taught by [Mr Patrick Swan](mailto:gw19swanpatrick@glow.sch.uk)

[Katherine Bridgewater](mailto:gw09bridgewaterkathe@glow.sch.uk) is our PE specialist.

We are part of the Eyemouth Learning Community (“Eyemouth cluster”) – children from Ayton, Coldingham, Cockburnspath, Eyemouth and Reston primary schools move up to together Eyemouth High School.
