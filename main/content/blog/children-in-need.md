On Friday our school organised a Pudsey day for the children at Ayton P.S. We did a treasure hunt with pudsey cards, we had to find 28 pudsey cards hidden around the classroom. Then we went to Mrs Pearson’s class to make biscuits and eat them. they were delicious! We then went to Mrs Lannagan’s class to make drawings of pudsey. After break we did a pudsey assembly and we watched a video about Children in Need. Fun fact: Pudsey was named after a town in Leeds.
