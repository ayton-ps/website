P6 from Reston and Ayton got together to do the Goblin car project. Two staff members from the high school race team came and showed us a green power presentation all about the new project. 

We got into teams and had to come up with a design theme for our car. üõ†Ô∏è 

We planned each side and decorated a drawing of the car according to our design. 

The themes of each groups car was, Axolotls, Dragons, Doodle Monsters and Racers. We then started painting our design onto the cardboard that will be attached to the car structure. 

Groups stuck objects onto the car to add to their design. 

Final day was race day, the team attached the panels onto the structure and we were given a safety instructions onto how to drive the car. Once we knew how to drive it was time to race round the track. We then came back to class for the presentation of the awards and driving licences. We all really enjoyed doing this event together and learned lots about designing, building and racing.
