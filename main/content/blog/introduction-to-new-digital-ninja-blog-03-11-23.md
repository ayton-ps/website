Welcome to the new 2023-2024 Digital Ninja Blog. As a Leadership Group we have 3 main goals this year:

1. Set up and support the use of technology in our school assemblies. \
2. We will be trained by Mrs Craig to offer technical IPad support to all classes. \
3. Each week we will write a blog for the website to share some of the exciting things classes are doing. We will do one class per week. 

Next week look out for our first class blog from P6.7.
