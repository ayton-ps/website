P4/5 have had a very busy week with lots of learning opportunities. \
They have started working with Mr Jacobâ€™s to learn the ukulele. They have learned are C F G and A chords.

With Mrs Craig they started learning to  code micro bits. They made the sound of a heart beat.

P4/5 have been working with children from Reston on a drama project. They were asking questions to older people about when there was no technology and life was a bit different. They also played fun games during drama and really enjoyed it. There teachers for drama are Mr Bissett his son Ollie.
