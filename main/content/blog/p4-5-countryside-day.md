P4/5 had a nice trip to Kelso on Tuesday 28th of May. They got to see lots of different animals like Guinea pigs, pigs, cow, sheep, goats and slugs. They got to see lots of different emergency service vehicles and they got lots of free stuff like milk and ice cream. Other activities they did was milking a fake cow; made a poster and badges; meat guessing. Everyone had a brilliant day out!
