On Thursday the 6th of February primary 5/6/7 went to cross country, they went on a bus to Eyemouth, they had to lap around all 3 fields twice. It was a very long way! They were split up into boys and girls races for each year group. Some of the people from Ayton came in the top ten. Everyone was really supportive and it was team bonding time. Everyone represented Ayton brilliantly. #smallbutmighty
