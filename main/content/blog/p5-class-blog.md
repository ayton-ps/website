In Maths we have been learning about multiplication - we have been doing 2 digit by 1 digit multiplication. In Literacy we have been learning about how to do suspense writing. We have also been learning how to uplevel a sentence. We made poppy magnets for Remembrance Day. We have been working really hard and enjoying the learning.
