P6/7 have had a busy week making pumpkin cupcakes. We used the pumpkins we grew in our school garden. The icing was cream cheese and it was delicious. This week we also worked really hard on our spelling words. We usedthe magnetic letters and the scrabble board to take part in practical tasks. A great week for the class.
