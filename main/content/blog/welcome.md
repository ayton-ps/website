Welcome to our school blog. This is where we will put whatâ€™s going on in P7. So far in our topic we have been learning about Scottish landscapes and today we made a mini volcano. In numeracy we are learning to multiply and divide by 10,100,1000. In literacy we have been learning about experiment writing.
