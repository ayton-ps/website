On Thursday the 7th of march our school did activities set by our library leaders to celebrate World Book Day. 

We had three activities, they were book mark designing, reading together with little finger flash lights and cookie designing in the style of the WBD symbol. \
We also worked with Berwickshire Swap to organise a book swap. Each child in school had a chance to take home a book that was new to them. 

Thank you to the Library Leaders for organising this brilliant day.
