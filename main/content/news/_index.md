Saturday 6th September is the annual Ayton Flower Show. The event is open from 1pm-4pm. Come
along and see the wonderful entries as well as entertainment and teas and coffees in the bowling club. All welcome. 

There are adult and children competition categories from photography to crafting and baking to growing. If you would like to enter a class please either:

A)   Go to [www.aytongardens.com](http://www.aytongardens.com) and enter online – children’s classes are free to enter. Normal deadline is Friday 29th August but this can be flexible.

B)   Print out a paper entry or fill in information on a blank sheet of paper and hand into Kenzie House on the High Street. 

In addition, the children at school are busy with art and handwriting entries from their classes and these will all be on show on the day. 

All children will receive a copy of this years “snail quiz” and children can either return entries to school or pop them into the quiz collection box on the day. 

Please enter a class and/or come along on the day to support our local show.
