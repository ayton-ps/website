Children have had a settled start to the new school session and are enjoying their new learning environments.

We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible at our open event on Wednesday 17th September 2-3pm. This is an opportunity for you to meet staff and see the different learning environments and resources we use to support teaching and learning. There will be further opportunities for this type of experience throughout the session.

Thank you,  
Mrs Horsburgh  
Head Teacher

## Attendance

If your child is unable to attend school for whatever reason, please contact the main school office using telephone phone number 018907 81350 or send us a message using Eduspot. If your child is absent from school please notify the school office as soon as you can. If not you will receive a Eduspot message. If your child is booked in for a lunch on ParentPay please ensure the meal is cancelled online, or you may be charged.

Please ensure your child arrives at school on time each day. If your child arrives at school late (up to 9.00am), please send them to the school office.

## ParentPay

## Safety of Pupils

Please ensure you close the gates leading to the playground on entrance and exit. All pupils cycling to school MUST wear a cycle helmet.

## Unauthorised Absences

If you take your child out of school during term time, this will be recorded as an ‘unauthorised absence’. We would encourage you to contact the school office and ask for a holiday request form in these circumstances.

## Break time snacks and water bottles

Please remember to provide your child with a healthy snack at break time, a piece of fruit for fruit fix in the afternoons plus a water bottle for use in class throughout the day. Water bottles should be labelled with your child’s name and must be filled from home. We are a health promoting school and would ask that bottles contain water and not juice, thank you.

## Uniform/PE Kit

ALL items of school uniform should be labelled. We also encourage all PE kit to be labelled. Please ensure that children with long hair have their hair tied back and NO jewellery is worn on PE days. If your child is unable to remove their own earrings, they must bring medical tape in from home to cover them.

## NHS Flu Vaccination Form

The majority of the forms have now been returned to school, if you have not returned the form please do so ASAP as the nursing team will collect them the week beginning 1st September.

## Curriculum Overviews

Curriculum Overviews will be issued to parents / carers week commencing Monday 1st September.

## Harvest Assembly

There will be a harvest assembly on Thursday 10th October in the school hall. We would be grateful for donations of non-perishable items. These will be passed on to a local food bank for families in need. Thank you.

## Medication in School

Please remember it is your responsibility to ensure medication/medical supplies in school for your child are within their expiry dates. Should your child need medication to be administered during the school day, please ask Mrs McAskill for a form which must be completed in advance. Medication to be administered within school MUST be prescribed and labeled with your child’s name.
