## ParentPay

Please remember to make bookings in advance for your children’s lunches, if
bookings are not made by 8.00am, children will be offered a meal, if they have
not brought a packed lunch. It is important to book in advance so the kitchen
has enough stock for each day.

## Attendance

Please do phone or Groupcall the school if your child will be absent from
school. The school office hours are 8.35am to 3.10pm, Monday to Thursday and
8.35am to 12.30 on a Friday. Mrs McAskill will send a group call message if a
child is absent and we have not heard why.

## Showbie

Showbie is a secure, online learning platform where teachers and students
can collaborate, celebrate success, empower learners, share content, and use
educational apps to supplement their learning from their class teacher.

Dear Parent/carer,

As part of our Improvement Planning processes to evaluate the quality of provision in Ayton Primary School we want to gather the views of key stakeholders (learners, parents/carers, staff and partners) to help us understand how we are doing. 

We value your views and encourage you to complete the survey using the link <https://forms.office.com/e/KpjgmzwKLr>.

Things to note:

* All adult survey response will be anonymous (there is no question asking for your name). 
* Q1: There is a drop-down menu enabling you to click on our school.
* Please complete one survey for each child. 
* At the end of the survey, if you would like to be part of a focus group you can add your contact details however this is not required. 
* The survey will ‘go live’ on Monday 3 February and ‘close’ on Friday 21 February.  

To understand how the council will collect and use your information, please read the privacy notice attached to this message.

Kind regards,
