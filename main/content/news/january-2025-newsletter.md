*Welcome back everyone, we hope you all had a lovely Christmas break and are ready for the new term.*

## Christmas Performance and Church Service

Thank you to everyone for their support and fantastic feedback after the
children performed the ‘The Fleece Force’ and ‘Christmas Around the
World,’ in the school hall last month. It was lovely to see so many of you in
Ayton Parish Church. Many thanks to all staff, Mrs Susan Patterson, Primary 7
pupils, and Mr. Graham Dolan for their support during these events.


## Winter Transport

Please remember that during the winter months our School Transport team
now use the Scottish Borders Council website to provide updates on school
transport affected by weather or road conditions. The webpage can be found at
<https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/wintertransport> and will be updated from 7.30am
as and when required.

It is important to remember that in normal circumstances children should not
wait more than 15 minutes for the bus, but in severely cold weather please make
your own judgement. If you decide to take your young person to school yourself,
you will be expected to collect them at the end of the school day.

## Staffing

Miss Rebecca Morton has returned from maternity leave and has returned to her
support for learning post on a Monday and a Tuesday. On a Wednesday morning, she
will be teaching P1/2 to allow Mrs Pearson her allocated weekly mentor time.

Miss Tracy Renton has moved on to a new post at Eyemouth Primary School. We
would like to thank Miss Renton for her hard work at Ayton Primary and we wish
her well for the future.

We are also joined this term by Miss Brooke Heary who will be completing her
student placement with us in P1/2 with Mrs Pearson

## Reminders

Breakfast club is from 8.00am until 8.30am and costs 50p per day. This can
be paid via ParentPay, please book in advance. If you use the Breakfast club
service, please drop children off before 8.15am so they have enough time to eat
and do not feel rushed. The playground is supervised from 8.30am, please do not
drop your child off before this unless they are attending Breakfast Club. On
mornings where weather is poor, the door to the school will be open and children
should head straight to their classrooms.

If your child is absent from school or if there is a change in circumstances
regarding pick up arrangements, please call the school office or email/groupcall
so that the relevant member of staff can be informed.

School starts at 8:45am, we notice that several children have been arriving late
in the mornings. Please try to ensure your child arrives at school on time to
start their learning for the day. There is playground supervision from 8:30am
with Miss Davidson, Mrs Virtue and Miss Sword.

School finishes at 3:10pm, please be mindful that staff have
meetings/preparation to do before they leave work at the end of their working
day and would appreciate your cooperation in collecting your child on time.

Please remember to provide your child with a snack at break time and a water
bottle for use in class with water. Water bottles should be labelled with pupil
name and can be filled at break time. Children are also welcome to bring in a
fruit fix snack for the afternoons if they wish to.
