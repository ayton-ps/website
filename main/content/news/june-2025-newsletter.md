## Parents Portal â€” Primary aged children only

Parents Portal is a new system that has been introduced by Scottish Borders
Council, with the goal of being a single hub for all communication between
parents / carers and schools. It is a platform which allows you to update your
childâ€™s information through the annual data check, give permissions for
various trips and activities, and receive notifications about school events and
activities via the school calendar. It will also allow you to link ParentPay and
other useful services to your home page.

Joining instructions have been issued to parents/carers, but please contact the
school office if you would like another copy. Thank you to the parents/carers
who have registered already ðŸ˜Š.

## Attendance

Please ensure your child arrives at the start of the school day on time, as we
still have a few children arriving after the bell at 8:45am.

Please do phone the school if your child will be absent from school. You can
also use the Xpressions app to notify the school. The school office hours are
8:30am to 3:10pm, Monday to Thursday and 8:30am to 12:30 on a Friday. Mrs
McAskill will send a Groupcall message if a child is absent and we have not
been given a reason.

wish the booking to be taken.

## Changes in pick up

Please contact the school before 2:30pm by telephone, email
<aytonps@scotborders.gov.uk> or use Xpressions, if you are changing your
childâ€™s pick-up arrangements at the end of the day. It is very important that
we know of changes so that class teachers can be informed.

## Water bottle and Snacks

Please ensure your child is sent to school with a filled water bottle and a
snack for break time. As the weather is getting better please feel free to
provide your child with sun cream.
