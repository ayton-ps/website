## Staffing Update

Mrs Horsburgh and Mrs MacLeod have been interviewing recently to cover Miss Morton’s
maternity leave, following the departure of Miss Tait who moved on to a new teaching post at the
end of January. We will be writing to parents and carers soon when we have a start date for
the teachers who will cover P6/7 to allow Mrs MacLeod her management time in both schools, and for
the teacher who will be teaching groups or individuals with additional support needs. In the meantime,
we have been fortunate enough to have experienced teacher working in the school on a supply basis.

## School Uniform
