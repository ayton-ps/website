parents can choose which session to attend on the letter that was received on
Tuesday 25th February. If slips could be handed back to either Mrs Pearson or
the school office, please.

## Tree Planting

On Wednesday 5th March P5 will be going to Ayton Castle to work with Rotary
and Border Forest Trust to plant some new trees in the grounds and learn about
sustainability in forestry. Can all P5s please wear suitable outdoor clothing
and footwear on Wednesday and bring a snack, water bottle and a spare change of
clothes. Children will be back at school for lunch as normal.

## Act for Change

We took part in February’s Act for Change month, in partnership with
Scottish Borders Climate Action Network (SBCan). We joined other schools and
organisations across the Scottish Borders in taking action to protect, enhance
or connect with the environment. The aim was to come together in February 2025
to inspire others and commit to making a positive impact in our community. We
decided to focus on making our playground a greener space and doing a community
litter pick. With help from an SBCan funding grant, and advice and support from
Pearsons of Duns Garden Centre, we have successfully planted wild flower beds
and installed bird feeders to attract wildlife to our playground, added shrubs
and flowers to enhance our green space, and positioned two new fruit trees
to replace the ones we lost during the trim trail development. P5 spent an
afternoon litter picking to help tidy up Ayton’s community spaces, around the
school. We are hoping to continue with this project through the summer term.

## Adult help required

We have two planters in the playground which need dug up and turned over so we
can plant some vegetables. If anyone would like to volunteer some time to help
with this we would really appreciate it.

## PFA Meeting

The next PFA meeting will be held on Monday 10th March at 3.15pm in school. All parents/carers are welcome to join.

## P6 Euroquiz

Euroquiz is an annual project open to all P6 pupils across Scotland, which sees
teams of four working together to broaden their knowledge of Europe and the
wider world. Subjects covered include languages, history, geography, culture and
European affairs. Heats take place in local authorities from February to March,
with the winning teams from all areas progressing to the National Euroquiz Final
in June.

This will be taking place on Wednesday 12th March.

## Red Nose Day

25th March from 10am to 12pm. The children have been working on their dance
