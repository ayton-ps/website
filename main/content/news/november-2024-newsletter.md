## School Lunches

## Harvest Thanks

Thank you to everyone who donated to the Harvest Festival table. The donations have been gratefully received by Rev Andy Haddow at the Eyemouth Parish Church Food Larder.

## Scholastic Book Fair

The Scholastic Book Fairs were held during the Parents Evenings last month and between the two evenings we managed to raise a fantastic £238 worth of free books for the school! A huge thank you to all who attended and bought books. Mrs Horsburgh and Mrs MacLeod are currently deciding on which books we can add to our library collection.


## Parking

We would like to remind parents to be mindful when parking in the school car park at the start and end of the school day. Cars in the car park are making it very difficult for the bus driver to maneuver in the area. It is also a risk to children walking while cars are reversing/parking.  We encourage parents to use space on the Beanburn, Lawfield Drive and if possible, in the new estate next to the school.

## P4-7 iPads

Please ensure all children in P4-7 bring their Inspire Learning iPads to school every day, charged at least to 50%.

## Halloween Disco

Parents from the school kindly organized a Halloween Party on Friday 25th October for the whole school. This was a lot of fun for all the children and we would like to say thank you to the parents for providing this and Paul Weallans for providing the disco. An impressive £75.41 was raised for the school. Thank you.
