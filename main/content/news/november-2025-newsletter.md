Dear Parents/Carers,

We have had a busy first couple of weeks of the new term since the October
half-term break. The children have all settled well into their school routines
and we look forward to sharing more examples of learning and updates through
Showbie, School Facebook page and in our newsletters. Many thanks to everyone
who came along to parents consultations before the October break. If you were
unable to make or keep an appointment, please do contact your child’s teacher
to rearrange via the school office.

I look forward to working with you all this term. Thank you for your ongoing
continued support.

Kind regards,  
Mrs Horsburgh  
Head Teacher

## Harvest Thanks

Thank you to everyone who donated to the Harvest Thanksgiving table. Your kind
donations have been greatly received by the Eyemouth Parish Church Larder.

## Staffing update

At the end of last term Mrs Laura Stobbart changed places of work and she is now
based at another school within the Eyemouth Learning Community. Mrs Stobbart
made a super contribution to the school in the time she was with us at Ayton
Primary. We wish her well and thank her for her contribution to our school.

We recently welcomed some new faces to our Pupil Support Assistant team
in school. Mrs Laura Purves and Mrs Deborah Butterfield. Both ladies are
experienced practitioners and will be working in their base schools of Reston
and Eyemouth Primary School, alongside some hours here at Ayton. They are both
very impressed with the warm welcome they have had from the children and staff.

Your child may also tell you that on occasion they may have met Mr Scott Agnew
or Mrs Elizabeth Hiroz, Depute Head Teachers at Eyemouth Primary Schools. Mr
Agnew and Mrs Hiroz are both experienced school leaders and they may on occasion
be in Ayton Primary School to support Mrs MacLeod and myself with the leadership
and management of the school.
