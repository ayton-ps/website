## Curriculum Overviews

Curriculum Overviews for P1–3, P4–5 and P6–7 will be issued by
Groupcall/Xpressions on **Friday 27th October**, your child will also be given a
paper copy in their school bag for you to retain for information. If you have
any questions please contact Mrs Pearson, Mrs Lannagan or Mrs MacLeod.

## Harvest Thanks

Thank you to everyone who donated to the Harvest Festival table. The donations
have been greatly received by Rev Andy Haddow at the Eyemouth Parish Church Food
Larder.

## PFA Meeting

The next PFA meeting will be held at the school on **Wednesday 8 November,
3:30pm–4:30pm**. All welcome.

## Parking

We would like to remind parents to be mindful when parking in the school car
park at the start and end of the school day. Cars in the car park are making it
very difficult for the bus driver to manoeuvre in the area. It is also a risk to
children walking while cars are reversing/parking. We encourage parents to use
space on the Beanburn, Lawfield Drive and if possible, in the new estate next to
the school.

## P4–7 iPads

Please ensure all children in P4–7 bring their Inspire Learning iPads to
school **every day, charged at least to 50%**.

## Migration from Tax Credits to Universal Credit

The UK government is ending tax credits, with eligible claimants required to
apply for Universal Credit instead. If you currently claim Tax Credits, look
out for a letter called Universal Credit Migration Notice from the Department
of Work and Pensions for more information and guidance on what you need to do.
More information is available [here](https://www.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk/tax-credits-customers/tax-credits-are-ending/).

## Halloween Disco

## Science

Dr Katherine Lymer, one of our science teachers from Eyemouth High School, is
starting a 6 week block supporting learning and teaching linked to our IDL
science block linked to forces, with all classes. On her visit last week,
getting to know the children across the school she was so impressed with their
engagement and enthusiasm towards their learning. Look out for evidence of
learning on Showbie on your child’s iPad or on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aytonps/).
