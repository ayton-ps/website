## Attendance

If your child is unable to attend school for whatever reason, please contact
the main school office using telephone phone number ([01890 781350](tel:00441890781350)) or send us a
message using Xpressions. If your child is absent from school please notify the
school office as soon as you can. If not you will receive a Groupcall message.
If your child is booked in for a lunch on ParentPay please ensure the meal is
cancelled online, or you may be charged.

## ParentPay

Please make meal choices for your child before 8.30am on the day you wish to
make the booking. If you are experiencing any problems accessing ParentPay
please contact Mrs McAskill in the office.

## Unauthorised Absences

If you take your child out of school during term time, this will be recorded
as an ‘unauthorised absence’. We would encourage you to contact the school
office and ask for a holiday request form in these circumstances.

## Uniform/PE Kit

ALL items of school uniform should be labelled, there are a number of jumpers
on our lost property table already. Please ensure that children with long hair
have their hair tied back and NO jewellery is worn on PE days. If your child is
unable to remove their own earrings, they must bring medical tape in from home
to cover them.

## JRSO 

The P6-7 JRSOs attended the JRSO conference on Teams on Thursday 19th September.
They enjoyed their training and have brought lots of great ideas to share with
the other P6-7 children who this year have formed a ‘P6-7 JRSO Committee’ so
they can all be involved.

## P5-P7 Rugby and Hockey Festival

P5-P7 will be taking part in this years Rugby and Hockey festival with P5 doing
rugby and P6/7 doing hockey on the 3rd of October at Eyemouth High School. This
is a great opportunity for pupils to meet other pupils from the cluster. Please
remember to give your child a snack and water bottle for the event. We should be
back in school around 12.30pm so children can still get a school lunch if they
have ordered one. Please ensure permission for this has been granted via the
ParentPay app. You will find this in the “Other New Items” section of your
child’s page.

## Walk to School Week

Walk to school week is 7th – 11th October. We would like to see as many
pupils walking to school, as possible. You could park and stride from a bit
further away than you usually do. Our JRSOs will also be running a competition
within school for Walk to School Week, pupils will get information about the
competition shortly.

## P1 to P7 Parent Consultations

Our next Parent Consultations are being held on the Monday 7th October at 3.15pm
until 5.00pm and the 9th of October at 5.00pm until 7.00pm. Emails were sent out
to parents with the link for booking. Please contact the school office if you
have a problem.


## Ayton PFA AGM

The Parents and Friends of Ayton Primary School will be holding their AGM on
Monday 28th October at 6:00pm in school. If you have any queries for the PFA
please contact <pfa@aytonprimary.com>.

## Asda Rewards – ParentKind

Parentkind have teamed up with Asda, who is making millions of pounds available
to donate to primary schools across the UK through their ‘Cashpot for
Schools’ initiative – all you have to do is, opt in through the Asda Rewards
app, choose our primary school and shop and scan in store or shop online at
[Asda.com](https://asda.com), between 2nd September and 30th November 2024.

Asda will donate 0.5% of the value of your shop to our PTA. Also, every time
somebody opts in, Asda will give an additional £1 to the school Cashpot. Plus,
it doesn’t stop there – Asda are also giving £50 to every school to get
them started.

## Scholastic Book Fair

This year we are hosting a Scholastic Book Fair during the Parent Consultations
above. The book fair will be held in school and we will have lots of fabulous
books to have a look at and buy. Every order will help get free books for the
school. Orders can be placed at the event by using the QR code. Unfortunately,
we are unable to accept cash. 

## Medication in School

Please remember it is your responsibility to ensure medication/medical supplies
in school for your child are within their expiry dates. Should your child need
medication to be administered during the school day, please ask Mrs McAskill for
a form which must be completed in advance. Medication to be administered within
school MUST be prescribed and labelled with your child’s name.

## Harvest Assembly

There will be a harvest assembly for pupils on Friday 11th October in the school
hall. We would be grateful for donations of non-perishable items next week.
These will be passed on to a local food bank for families in need. Thank you in
advance.

## Halloween Disco

School parents have organised a school Halloween Disco on Friday the 25th of
October. P1-4 at 6:00pm until 7:00pm and P5-7 will be at 7:15pm until 8:15pm.
Entry costs £1 per child and juice and a snack will be provided. Children can
come in Halloween costume or in normal clothes.

## Respectful Relationships and Anti Bullying Policy

It is our vision that all learning establishments are safe, respectful and
nurturing environments where bullying behaviour is never acceptable. It is
therefore critical that those who play a role in the lives of children and young
people in the Scottish Borders are equipped to prevent and respond effectively
to incidents of bullying behaviour. Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) in
the Scottish Borders ensures that the child and their family are at the centre
of policy and practice and that the views of the child, young person and their
parents/carers are sought, listened to and taken into account when decisions are
being made. Please see [here](https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/info/20041/support_for_pupils/590/anti-bullying) for more.
