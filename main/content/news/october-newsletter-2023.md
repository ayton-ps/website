**Attendance**
If your child is unable to attend school for whatever reason, please contact the main school office using telephone phone number 018907 81350 or send us a message using Xpressions. If your child is absent from school please notify the school office as soon as you can. If not you will receive a Groupcall message. If your child is booked in for a lunch on ParentPay please ensure the meal is cancelled online, or you may be charged.

**ParentPay**
Please make meal choices for your child before 8.30am on the day you wish to make the booking. If you are experiencing any problems accessing ParentPay please contact Mrs McAskill in the office.

**Facebook Page and Blog – Ayton Primary School**
Please ‘like’ and ‘follow’ our school Facebook page, it is a great tool to allow us to share the children’s learning experiences with you. The page also features up to date information on events, news updates and the monthly newsletter. We regularly display photos of the children as well as their learning activities.

Also, our blog can be found at aytonprimary.com where you can find our newsletters, handbooks and information about the school.

**Unauthorised Absences**
If you take your child out of school during term time, this will be recorded as an ‘unauthorised absence’. We would encourage you to contact the school office and ask for a holiday request form in these circumstances.

**Uniform/PE Kit**\
ALL items of school uniform should be labelled, there are a number of jumpers on our lost property table already. Please ensure that children with long hair have their hair tied back and NO jewellery is worn on PE days. If your child is unable to remove their own earrings, they must bring medical tape in from home to cover them. 

**P1 to P7 Parent Consultations**
Our next Parent Consultations are being held on the 3rd of October at 5pm until 7pm and the 4th of October at 3.15pm until 5pm. Emails were sent out to parents with the link for booking. Please contact the school office if you have a problem. 

**Staffing Update:**
Miss Morton will be starting her maternity leave after the October break. We wish her and her family well in the coming months. We have been recruiting for a successful candidate to cover Miss Morton’s maternity leave and will be able to share more details with you after the October break.

**Medication in School**
Please remember it is your responsibility to ensure medication/medical supplies in school for your child are within their expiry dates.  Should your child need medication to be administered during the school day, please ask Mrs McAskill for a form which must be completed in advance.  Medication to be administered within school MUST be prescribed and labeled with your child’s name.

**Bikeability**
The school has been given the chance for P5 and P6 to take part in the Bikeability programme led by Scottish Borders Council Outdoor Education team, fully funded by Scottish Borders Council, Cycling Scotland, and Smarter Choices. The activity will take place during the school day at the end of October, drop off and pick up at school will be the same as normal. A more in-depth letter will be sent out to P5 and P6 parents after the October holidays. 

**Harvest Assembly**
There will be a harvest assembly on Friday 6th October in the school hall. We would be grateful for donations of non-perishable items next week.  These will be passed on to a local food bank for families in need on 6th October.   Thank you in advance.

**PFA Halloween Disco**
The PFA have organized a school Halloween Disco on Friday the 27th of October. P1-4 at 6pm until 7pm and P5-7 will be at 7.30pm until 8.30pm. Entry costs £1 per child and juice and a snack will be provided. 

**Respectful Relationships and Anti Bullying Policy**\
It is our vision that all learning establishments are safe, respectful and nurturing environments where bullying behaviour is never acceptable. It is therefore critical that those who play a role in the lives of children and young people in the Scottish Borders are equipped to prevent and respond effectively to incidents of bullying behaviour. Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) in the Scottish Borders ensures that the child and their family are at the centre of policy and practice and that the views of the child, young person and their parents/carers are sought, listened to and taken into account when decisions are being made. Please see the attached leaflet with further information or follow the link: Anti-bullying | Scottish Borders Council (scotborders.gov.uk)
