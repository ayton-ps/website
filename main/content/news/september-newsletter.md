It was lovely to see many of you at our recent open afternoon on 31st August. We enjoyed welcoming you all back in to school and showing you the different learning environments and resources we use to support teaching and learning. There will be further opportunities for this type of experience throughout the session.

Thank you,  
Mrs Horsburgh

## Attendance

If your child is unable to attend school for whatever reason, please contact the main school office using telephone phone number 018907 81350 or send us a message using Xpressions. If your child is absent from school please notify the school office as soon as you can. If not you will receive a Groupcall message. If your child is booked in for a lunch on ParentPay please ensure the meal is cancelled online, or you may be charged.

Please ensure your child arrives at school on time each day. 

## ParentPay

Please make meal choices for your child before 8.30am on the day you wish to make the booking. If you are experiencing any problems accessing ParentPay please contact Mrs McAskill in the office.

## Annual Data Check Form

Annual Data Check forms have already gone home and should have been returned by now. We are still waiting on a few to be returned, please ensure these are checked and returned ASAP. 

## Facebook Page and Blog – Ayton Primary School

Please ‘like’ and ‘follow’ our school Facebook page, it is a great tool to allow us to share the children’s learning experiences with you. The page also features up to date information on events, news updates and the monthly newsletter. We regularly display photos of the children as well as their learning activities.

Also, our blog can be found at <aytonprimary.com> where you can find our newsletters, handbooks and information about the school.

## Safety of Pupils

Please ensure you close the gates leading to the playground on entrance and exit. 

## Unauthorised Absences

If you take your child out of school during term time, this will be recorded as an ‘unauthorised absence’. We would encourage you to contact the school office and ask for a holiday request form in these circumstances.

## Break time snacks and water bottles

Please remember to provide your child with a healthy snack at break time, a piece of fruit for fruit fix in the afternoons plus a water bottle for use in class throughout the day.  Water bottles should be labelled with your child’s name and must be filled from home. We are a health promoting school and would ask that bottles contain water and not juice, thank you.

## Uniform/PE Kit  

ALL items of school uniform should be labelled, there are a number of jumpers on our lost property table already. Please ensure that children with long hair have their hair tied back and NO jewellery is worn on PE days. If your child is unable to remove their own earrings, they must bring medical tape in from home to cover them. 

## NHS Flu Vaccination Form

Please return this form completed and signed in the brown envelope provided by Monday 4th September. 

## JRSO 

The P6-7 JRSOs attended the JRSO conference on Teams on Wednesday 30th August.  They enjoyed their training and have brought lots of great ideas to share with the other P6-7 children who this year have formed a ‘P6-7 JRSO Committee’ so they can all be involved.

## Parent Friends Association

There will be Parent Council Forum meeting held in the school on Thursday 14th September 6.30pm-7.30pm.   All parents and carers are welcome to attend. 

## Curriculum Overviews

## P6-7 St Abbs Science Festival

On Friday 22nd September P6-7 at Ayton have been invited to the first St Abbs Science Festival. Schools in the area are attending this event free of charge. St Abbs and the Berwickshire coast are special and unique known for their rich biodiversity, wonderful flora and fauna and stunning geology.

EV2s and a letter will follow with further detail in due course. 

Please note the festival is running at the weekend and workshops are available to book online for the Saturday.
