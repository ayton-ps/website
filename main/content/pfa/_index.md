# Parents and Friends Association

Our parent council is called _Parents and Friends Association of Ayton Primary School_. You can email us at **<hello@pfa.aytonprimary.com>**. We regularly meet as a group and with staff to chat about the school. All parents and guardians are part of the Parent Forum and are welcome to attend! We would love for you to get involved.

We have a WhatsApp community that can be joined using [this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IMIKw6mAWwPLwtnA9n79B4).
