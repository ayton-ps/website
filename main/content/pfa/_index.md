# Parents and Friends Association

Our Parent Council body is called _Parents and Friends Association of Ayton Primary School_. You can email us at **<hello@pfa.aytonprimary.com>** and join our WhatsApp community with [this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IMIKw6mAWwPLwtnA9n79B4). We regularly meet as a group and with staff to chat about the school. All parents and guardians are part of the Parent Forum and are welcome to attend! We would love for you to get involved.

**The next meeting will be on 22 September 2025 at 8pm on Zoom. Join the WhatsApp community for the link.**
