# Breakfast club ðŸ¥£

With the help of some fantastic volunteers, the school runs a breakfast club every school day from 08:00 to 08:30.
Please book and pay for your childâ€™s place on [ParentPay](https://www.parentpay.com).
It costs 50p, or is free if you are eligible for Free School Meals.

Please make sure you receive messages from the school via email or Xpressions for any updates to the schedule.

## Volunteering

The breakfast club is really well attended and is an essential part of many familiesâ€™ days.
We need more volunteers to ensure it can reliably run.
You don't have to be a parent to volunteer!
If you can help out, please get in contact with the school by [ringing](tel:+441890781350), [emailing](mailto:aytonps@scotborders.gov.uk), or visiting the reception.
