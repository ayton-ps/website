# Parents & Friends Association (PFA): Our Constitution

*Approved at February 2023 meeting*

## A Role with the School and the Community

### Our aims

The aims of the PFA of Ayton Primary School are to:

* support the school to create a welcoming environment that is inclusive for all pupils
* effectively represent the views of the parent community to the school and local authority
* engage in activities that will achieve the best educational opportunities for pupils
* ensure we proactively support effective communications between parents, the school, and the community.

## About membership of the PFA

1. PFA membership is a minimum of three parents of children attending the school. The maximum
size is 20. While meeting attendance is important as a member, active participation is more so, as
there are always things to get involved with during the school year for which help is very welcome.
In the unlikely event of non-participation, a member may be voted off.
2. Any parent of a child at the school can volunteer to be a member of the PFA. In the event that
the number of members exceeds the number set out in the constitution, members will be elected
by a vote of members present at the AGM.
3. The Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary and Treasurer will be agreed by the members of the PFA on an
annual basis at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). There may be additional office bearers as
appropriate (e.g. Fundraising rep).
4. The PFA will be chaired by a parent of a child attending Ayton Primary School.
    * If the child ceases to be a pupil, a new Chair will be agreed at the next meeting.
    * The Chair should not be a parent that has only a P7 pupil in school. This is to ensure effective handover and AGM attendance, for the following academic year.
    * The PFA is accountable to Ayton School Parents Forum (of which all the parents of the school are automatically members: see below), and will make a report to it at least once each year on its activities on behalf of all parents.
    * The PFA will meet at least once every school term.
5. The AGM is to be held in the first term of the school year. A notice of the meeting including the
date, time and place will be sent to all members of the PFA at least two weeks in advance. The
meeting agenda will include:
    * A report on the work of the PFA and its committee.
    * A review of the membership of the PFA.
    * Discussion of issues that members of the PFA or/the Pupil Council may wish to raise.
    * Approval of the accounts.
6. Should a vote be necessary to make a decision, each member of the PFA present at the meeting
will have one vote, with the Chair having two votes – one as a member of the PFA and one as
the casting vote in the event of a tie.
    * "As long as all parents have been told of the meeting and of the main items of business
      in adequate time, there is no need to have a large quorum. This might be difficult to
      achieve and prevent the Parent Council from holding a proper AGM."
7. If a PFA member acts in a way that is considered by other members to undermine the objectives
of the PFA as stated above, their membership will be terminated if the majority of the PFA
members agree. Termination of membership will be confirmed to the member in writing.
8. The Secretary is responsible for accurate minute taking and liaising with the school to share this
information with families of pupils. Copies of all meeting Minutes will be available to all parents
of children at Ayton Primary School and to all staff members. These will be available from the
Secretary, from the school office, and from the Ayton PS website (https://aytonprimary.com).
9. The Headteacher or their representative has a right and a duty to attend the meetings of the
PFA. They do not have a right to vote on matters.
10. PFA meetings are open to the public, and community representatives are welcome, including
the Ayton Community Council, unless the PFA are discussing an issue that it considers should be
dealt with on a confidential basis. In such circumstances, only members of the PFA and the
Headteacher – or their representative – can attend.
    * Information on PFA business will be relayed to all parents on a regular basis via emailing
      of the Minutes, messages from the school, and other social media channels.
11. The Treasurer plus one other member of the PFA should have access to and be named on the
PFA bank account. Activities on the account should have the prior approval of the office bearers.
    * The Treasurer will keep an accurate record of all income and expenditure and will
    provide a summary for this at every PFA meeting, and full accounts for the year at the
    AGM, with notice given at least six weeks in advance to the PFA. The PFA accounts will
    be approved annually by someone who is known to and trusted by the PFA, and who is
    independent of the association. The individual does not have to be a qualified
    accountant.
    * The PFA are collectively responsible for ensuring that all money received by or for the
    Parent Council or Forum will be used to aid the aims of the PFA as stated above.
12. The PFA may change its constitution after obtaining consent from two thirds of members.
Members of the PFA will be sent a copy of any proposed amendment and given reasonable time
to respond to the proposal.
13. Should the PFA cease to exist, remaining funds will be passed to the school.
14. The term parent applies equally to parents and carers.
