## P7’s transition to S1/Residential trip alternative activities

Update from AM on first meeting about changes to P7 transition activities (second meeting not attended). General feedback from Ayton P7 parents is positive. JH: It will be a good transition, with a day at Foxlake, a day at Eyemouth fields and a day at the high school. This year's activities is not necessarily an indicator of what next year's will be. Thanks to generous grant from Simpsons Malt for transportation costs.
