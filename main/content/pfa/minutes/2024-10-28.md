## Chairperson’s report

> We welcome you to the AGM of the Parents and Friends Association of Ayton Primary School (PFA). Below is our joint Chair/Vice Chair report for the school session 2023-2024.
>
> This AGM sees all four of our current office bearers step down after many years of volunteering their time. Amy has been our Chair alongside Tracey as Vice Chair for the past two years. Louise has been secretary for the past year but this is her second time in the role so we are thankful her returning for 23/24 session. Ellie will be passing on the treasurer role after four years in post. This leaves chair/vice chair and secretary positions available.
>
> Every parent of a child in school is welcome to attend meetings to find out what is happening in school and contribute to decisions about future projects/school trips/fundraising plus much more. Every parent is also welcome to join PFA and become a member which means they will work more closely with the office bearers and school staff.
>
> There are opportunities via SBC of training sessions and wider parent council meetings in the Scottish Borders. If anyone wants to know more about the role of a PFA/parent council, there is more information available on the SBC website or via Connect which supports partnerships in education.
>
> #### Achievements
>
> In the continuing theme of Ayton PS being “small but mighty”, we have achieved a lot this past year:
>
> - A group of parents ran two brilliant Halloween parties for all the pupils in school.
> - This school year saw the start of plans for an outdoor trim trail for the children, a fundraising group formed and a goal of £25k was set. Currently the total stands at around 30k. This was achieved by a drive from a group of parents and the school community, a particular thanks to Joanna for coordinating the efforts.
> - Continual fundraising events organised throughout the year have allowed the PFA to support school in many ways. For example, a Christmas raffle, a sponsored walk, a bake sale on sports day and the 50/50 draw all contributed towards having the funds available to fund transport for trips and sporting events, a whole school Christmas pantomime trip and P7 legacy books.
>
> A full breakdown of income and expenditure can be found in the accounts attached.
>
> Overall, a huge thanks to all the parents who give up their time to attend meetings, volunteer daily in school and fundraise in many ways, it is very much appreciated by the whole school community.
>
> #### Looking Forward
>
> It is very exciting to have a group of new office bearers to lead the PFA forward. We hope to maintain the level of support over the next year and always welcome new members and ideas. We also welcome opportunities to work with members of our wider school community.
>
> Even if you cannot attend a meeting (as we know that they may not always be at a time that is convenient with you), if you have any ideas that you’d like to share, you would like to join in with fundraising/organising an event, or have issues to raise, please email pfa@aytonprimary.com or speak with someone from the PFA at the school gates.
