# Pickleball Club

<img src="/i/pfa/pickleball-club.svg" alt="Ayton PS Pickleball Club" style="width:25%;height:auto;float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">

Starting 26 January, there will be an after-school pickleball club for P5â€“6s. The club is run by two parents of the school, with generous support from [BAVS](https://www.bavs.org.uk) for setting up the group, and help from [Active Schools](https://sportscotland.org.uk/schools/active-schools/) in organisation and admin.

The club's initial run is for four Thursday afternoons from 3:15pm to 4:15pm, although the plan is to continue the club indefinitely. It is free to attend, but registration is required as spaces are limited.

## What is pickleball?

Pickleball is a 50 year old sport created by a family looking to play a racquet sport that could be enjoyed by all members of the family, regardless of age and ability. It is often described as a cross between tennis, badminton and table tennis, and its rules are designed to create long rallies. It has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years.
