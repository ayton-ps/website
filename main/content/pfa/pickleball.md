Starting 26 January, there will be an after-school pickleball club for P5â€“6s. The club is run by two parents of the school, with generous support from [BAVS](https://www.bavs.org.uk) for setting up the group, and help from [Active Schools](https://sportscotland.org.uk/schools/active-schools/) in arranging sign-ups and background checks.

## What is pickleball?

Pickleball is a 50 year old sport created by a family looking to play a racquet sport that could be enjoyed by all members of the family, regardless of age and ability. It is often described as a cross between tennis, badminton and table tennis, and is claimed to be the fastest growing sport in the world.
