# Pickleball Club

<img src="/i/pfa/pickleball-club.svg" alt="Ayton PS Pickleball Club" style="width:25%;height:auto;float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">

Ayton PS Pickleball Club is run by two parents of the school, with generous support from [BAVS](https://www.bavs.org.uk) for setting up the group, and help from [Active Schools](https://sportscotland.org.uk/schools/active-schools/) in organisation and admin.

The club is not currently running due to lack of space in the hall. Efforts are being made to start a cluster club at Eyemouth HS.

## What is pickleball?

Pickleball was created almost 60 years ago by families looking to play a racquet sport that could be enjoyed by all members of the family, regardless of age and ability. It is often described as a cross between tennis, badminton and table tennis, and its rules are designed to create long rallies. It has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years.
