Ayton PS Pickleball Club is run by two parents of the school, with generous support from [BAVS](https://www.bavs.org.uk) for setting up the group, and help from [Active Schools](https://sportscotland.org.uk/schools/active-schools/) in organisation and admin.

The club's second session started on 18 May and is running for 6 weeks, until the end of term. It is currently only open to P7s.

## What is pickleball?

Pickleball is a 50 year old sport created by a family looking to play a racquet sport that could be enjoyed by all members of the family, regardless of age and ability. It is often described as a cross between tennis, badminton and table tennis, and its rules are designed to create long rallies. It has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years.
