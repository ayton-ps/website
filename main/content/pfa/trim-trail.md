# Weʼre raising £20,000 to transform Ayton Primary's Playground

*Our progress so far*

Imagine a playground where where every jump sparks joy, and where climbing ignites imaginations. That's the dream at Ayton Primary School – and you can help make it a reality!

Before: Picture our playground now: a blank canvas, a bit grey, vacant. Our energetic P1 to P7 students are super enthusiastic but have nowhere to climb, jump, or balance. Their adventures are grounded, their playtime limited.

After: Now, envision a vibrant Trim Trail, a wonderland of fixed and loose parts play equipment. This isn't just a playground; it's a launchpad for creativity, a gym for young explorers, a haven for developing minds and bodies.

The Mission: The Parents and Friends of Ayton Primary School (PFA) are on a mission to raise £20,000. Every penny brings us closer to giving our kids the playground they deserve – a place where they can soar, dream, and grow.

And if you want to know how vital this is…

1. Social and Emotional Growth: Outdoor play enhances social skills and emotional well-being, but its absence can lead to increased anxiety and hinder social development.
2. Cognitive Development: Outdoor Play is essential for cognitive growth, aiding children in processing the world. Lack of play can impede learning and lead to emotional and mental health concerns like depression.
3. Physical Health: Active outdoor play is crucial for physical health and development. During periods of restricted play, such as the pandemic, limited physical activity led to heightened anxiety and a shift in behaviours, impacting overall well-being.
