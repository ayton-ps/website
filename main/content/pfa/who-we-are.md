# Who we are

The Parents and Friends of Ayton Primary School (PFA) is the Parent Council body for our School.

The Parent Council is a group of parents/carers selected by members of the Parent Forum to
represent their views. All parents/carers are automatically members of the Parent Forum for the
school, and they have a right to establish a Parent Council to represent them. Parent Councils have
an important role to play in school improvement by ensuring that the parental perspective is
represented and taken into account. Parent councils are constituted bodies, they are independent
from the school and the local authority.

## Office bearer roles

### The chairperson

The chair’s role is to guide the PFA to achieve its aims and chair the meetings of the PFA. They will:

- Liaise with the secretary and head teacher on the agenda and meeting arrangements.
- Ensure fair discussion and that everyone gets a chance to have their say.
- Sum up issues, points, and decisions.
- Ensure decisions are carried out.

### The secretary

The secretary supports communication, between PFA members themselves and between parents
and the PFA. They will:

- Work with the chair to make arrangements for meetings and prepare an agenda.
- Send a notice of the meeting, venue and agenda to all parents/carers.
- Take minutes of meetings, including attendance, recording decisions and actions to be taken and by whom.
- Share minutes for all parents/carers following the meetings.

### The treasurer

The treasurer will handle the finances of the PFA, but not the actual raising of money. They will:

- Have a clear and accurate book keeping system that records any money received and how it is spent.
- Maintain the bank account.
- Advise on the amount of money available for the PFA.
- Produce an annual financial report.

## Sub-groups

It is always welcomed to have some sub-groups to carry out specific tasks and play an active part in
the PFA. These include fundraising and events.

## Members

All PFA members play a central role in helping to achieve our aims. We hold regular meetings, aiming
for one each term. At meetings, should a vote be necessary to make a decision, each member of the
PFA present at the meeting will have one vote, with the chair having two votes—one as a member
of the PFA and one as the casting vote in the event of a tie.

Our meeting times will be advertised through our school newsletter, Eduspot and on the school
website. Minutes from our meetings will always be shared.

Everyone is very welcome to attend—you don’t have to be a member of the PFA to come along.
Anyone can raise an issue for the PFA to discuss, please contact one of the members if you would
like to discuss any aspect of school.

Our current PFA members are:

- **Chair:** Joanna Stewart
- **Secretary:** Louise Birkett
- **Treasurer:** Toby Foster
- Katie Aitchison
- Laura Cooksey
- Rachel Davidson
- Amy Meek
- Ellie Moriarty
- Jo Roberts

_Effectively represent and report on the views of parents on the education provided by the school, and
other matters affecting the education and welfare of the pupils._

- Provide a voice for parents in schools and in the local authority on issues that are important to them
- Communicate regularly with the Parent Forum to hear their views and keep them informed.

## What we don’t do

We do not pursue issues regarding individual children or families, these should be discussed with a
member of school staff as appropriate.

We do not have input in the school calendar, dates are normally decided by school and we support
the school staff.
