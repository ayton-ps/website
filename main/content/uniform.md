# School uniform

Uniform with embroidered school logo is [available from FPUniformz](https://www.fpuniformz.com/product-category/schools/primary-school/ayton-primary-school/), but *the embroidered logo is not required*.

We wear:

* Light blue polo shirt (with or without school badge)
* Grey (or black) trousers, shorts, skirt or pinafore
* Burgundy jumper, cardigan or sweatshirt (with or without school badge)
* Alternatively, blue, summer gingham dresses can be worn
* Primary 7 children may choose to wear a royal blue sweatshirt

**On Tuesdays and Thursdays, children should come to school in PE kit. There
is no need to bring school uniform.** The uniform for PE is:

* School sweatshirt as above
* Black, grey or navy joggers or shorts
* Plain t-shirt in your childâ€™s House colour (Robin: red, Sparrow: yellow, Wren: green)
* Sensible trainers/gym shoes

Earrings should be taped up or removed on PE days.

We occasionally have non-uniform or dress up days.
