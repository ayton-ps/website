# School uniform

Uniform with embroidered school logo is [available from FPUniformz](https://www.fpuniformz.com/product-category/schools/primary-school/ayton-primary-school/), or Border Embroideries but *the embroidered logo is not required*.

Each day children are expected to wear:

* Light blue polo shirt (with or without school badge)
* Black or grey trousers, shorts, skirt or pinafore
* Burgundy jumper, cardigan or sweatshirt (with or without school badge)
* Alternatively, blue, summer gingham dresses can be worn
* Primary 7 children may choose to wear a royal blue sweatshirt (with or without school badge)
* All children should have a pair of indoor shoes in school each day to change into if needed. 

**On Tuesdays and Thursdays, children have PE with Miss Bridgewater. Children should wear normal school uniform and then change for PE.** 

 The uniform for PE is:

* Black, grey or navy joggers or shorts
* Plain t-shirt - No football strips should be worn
* Sensible trainers/gym shoes - these can be the same as their indoor shoes. 

Earrings should be taped up or removed on PE days.

We occasionally have non-uniform or dress up days and will inform families of this in advance via GroupCall, Facebook and email.
